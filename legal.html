            <p>Welcome to International Panel Shop. These Comprehensive Terms of Service ("Terms") govern all repair services provided by International Panel Shop ("we," "us," or "our") to you, the customer ("you" or "your").</p>

            <h2>1. Scope of Services and Limitations of Liability</h2>
            <p><strong>1.1. Core Services:</strong> International Panel Shop specializes exclusively in professional auto-body repair, encompassing panel-beating and spray-painting[cite: 3, 7, 17, 18]. Our services are strictly limited to the exterior bodywork and finish of your vehicle[cite: 37].</p>
            <p><strong>1.2. Exclusions from Responsibility:</strong> We expressly state that International Panel Shop cannot and will not be held responsible for any damage, malfunction, or issues related to Vehicle Glass, Upholstery, Mechanical Components, or Electronic Systems.</p>
            <p><strong>1.3. Electrical and Electronic Issues Disclaimer:</strong> You acknowledge that vehicle collisions and subsequent bodywork repairs can, at times, reveal or exacerbate pre-existing electrical or electronic issues. International Panel Shop explicitly disclaims any responsibility or liability for such issues.</p>

            <h2>3. Estimated Completion and Vehicle Collection</h2>
            <p><strong>3.4. Storage Fees:</strong> If your vehicle is not collected within 24 hours of completion notification, a daily storage fee of R450.00 will be charged.</p>
            <p><strong>3.5. Uncollected Vehicles and Disposal:</strong> Vehicles uncollected for a period exceeding 4 months will be handed over to Salvage Genie for lawful disposal to recover outstanding charges.</p>

            <h2>5. Warranty on Repairs and Parts</h2>
            <p><strong>5.2. Paintwork Warranty:</strong> Our paintwork is warranted for a period of 1 (one) year from the date of collection. This covers fading, peeling, or significant discoloration directly attributable to our application process.</p>
            <p><strong>5.3. Exclusion of Warranty:</strong> There is absolutely NO WARRANTY on any aftermarket or second-hand parts supplied or fitted at your request. Rust repairs are also inherently challenging and are not guaranteed for any period.</p>
